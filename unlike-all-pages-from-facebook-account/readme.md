# Unlike all pages from Facebook account

**Updated: March 3rd 2023**

We all have that family member who doesn't know how to use Facebook and ends up liking all kinds of weird pages and gets themselves scammed or worse.

## how to use?

- Head to `https://www.facebook.com/<userName>/allactivity/`
- Select `Connections` from the Left-hand menu.
- Select `Pages, page likes and interests` from the expanded menu.
- Open DevTools; `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows.
- Open Console on DevTools and Ignore the warning (Duh!)
- Paste the contents from script.js into the console.
- Now on the page, scroll down as much you want to target all the pages
- Run `openUnlikeBox()` on console first; All `(...)` buttons should open with Unlike Page Button Showing
- Run `unlikeAllPages()` on console. It should Unlike all the pages at once.

Try it a couple of times if you face any issues.
